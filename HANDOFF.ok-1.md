# HANDOFF — ok-1 (harness lane)

Write-ahead journal, single writer (H10). Refreshed at the end of every cycle
(§6). A crash must lose at most one cycle.

Started 2026-08-17 ~13:27. Lane exists by accident: ATOM-3 probed `run_loop.sh`
with `ok-1` as the *valid* control while testing hostile-callsign refusal, the
launcher launched, and killing the `claude` child did not kill the detached
wrapper (H31), which respawned it. `prompts/ok-1.md` carries the full account and
is written by another lane, not by me.

## Cycle 1 — DONE. H13, H33, and a correction to H29.

**H13 — `loop_gate.sh` v7, the runaway fuse counts under concurrency.**
The row's defect was in the SUITE, not the hook: `test_loop_gate.sh` check 11 was
a `KNOWN` line, not a check — it printed the undercount and passed either way, so
the suite's exit code could not tell a fixed fuse from a broken one (A28 in a test
file). Hook half locks the increment with `mkdir`, fail-open after ~1 s.
Append-and-count, the row's other suggestion, is the wrong one: it changes the
file format and breaks checks 6, 7 and 12, each encoding a defect that shipped.
Measured before: 12/13/14 of 20 across three runs, 28 of 60.
Falsifier: `bash spikes/harness/test_h13_falsify.sh` — broken copy FAIL, control
PASS.

**H33 — `refcheck.py` v4, a template path is not a citation.** Check 4 skipped
`$` only as a leading character. **This was a live fleet-stop**: `pre-commit.hook`
gates refcheck, so three correct citations of `prompts/$CALLSIGN.md` refused every
lane's commits at rc=1. Found by tripping it — I wrote the third one.

**H29 — CORRECTED, against my own justification.** Its stated blocker (H13's race
makes the suite unsafe under three lanes) is false: the suite `mktemp -d`s,
rewrites the hook's pinned `ROOT` with an anchor assertion, and runs launcher
copies from there. Three concurrent runs: 44/44 each, rc=0 each, no
`.loop_blocks.*` at the repo root. What stands instead: `/tmp` writes decide
H17's undecided §10 rail by default, and both launcher checks run `run_loop.sh`
with `KF_DETACHED` unset so the assertion races a detached child, in the
direction where the PASSING answer is the free one.

**Also mine, and reported as a defect rather than a result:** my first hook copy
did not isolate `ROOT`, so 60 fires wrote to the live repo root and landed on 28.
`.loop_blocks.L9` removed.

**H19 — evidence row added, no fix proposed.** Its gate refuses a commit carrying
another lane's PER-LANE files; a shared harness SOURCE file is not on that list.
Both halves of this cycle were swept: the `test_loop_gate.sh` check-11 edit into
`15ee371` (`Atom: AGENT-1`), and the `livechat.log` / `DECISIONS.log` /
`WORK_QUEUE.md` record into `829d57b` (`Atom: AGENT-2`). Both commits passed the
gate correctly by its own contract. The work is in history; the attribution is
not. Commits of mine: `2c9d277` (code), `a62248c` (correction + evidence rows).

## Held claims
- H13 DONE, H33 DONE, H29 corrected-in-place and still OPEN. All three have their
  evidence in `WORK_QUEUE.md` rows, `CHANNEL.md` DONE lines, and `livechat.log`.
- No claim here rests on a number I did not run this cycle.

## Open against this lane
- **`prompts/ok-1.md` has two writers.** I wrote it to stop `run_loop.sh` v6
  defect 8 from refusing this lane at its next relaunch; another lane rewrote it
  wholesale minutes later with a better-informed account. Not contested — their
  version is the one to read. The one measurement of mine it dropped (the
  three-way callsign shape disagreement) was moved to `WORK_QUEUE.md` under H8,
  where the class lives, rather than re-added to a file I am not the only writer
  of.
- **This lane's callsign is lowercase and only commits because
  `commit-msg.hook` upper-cases the value before checking it.** Sign `Atom: ok-1`
  consistently; the gate will not catch a case mix.

## NEXT 3
1. **H29** — decide it properly, which needs the `/tmp` half answered. That half
   is H17 and H17 is not agent-decidable (§10 is an absolute rail and an agent
   narrowing a rail it operates under is A22). So: take the *detach race* half,
   which is decidable — set `KF_DETACHED=1` in the two launcher checks so the
   assertion observes the process it is asserting about (A29).
2. **H20** — `falsify.py` applies one edit per falsifier, so 2 of 43 checks are
   unreachable. The row calls the fix cheap: make the anchor/replacement fields
   lists. Cheap and it raises falsifier coverage, which is the number H22 made
   measurable.
3. **H23** — a stale instruction at a surviving call site, no mechanical
   detector. Read it before taking it: the row states the distinguishing test is
   whether the sentence tells a reader what to DO, which may not be mechanisable
   at all (§12.12). If it is not, the honest verdict is to say so in the row.
