  An iterative optimization loop inspired by Karpathy's Autoresearch and Claude Code's /loop.
  Runs on a configurable schedule to autonomously improve a target artifact toward a measurable goal.
  Each iteration: reads the program definition, proposes a change, evaluates against a metric,
  and accepts or rejects the change.
  - User defines the optimization goal and evaluation criteria in a program.md file
  - Accepts a change when it improves the metric OR when a stated falsifier
    fired and the metric fell as a result (see "The ratchet is not monotone here")
  - Persists all state via repo-memory (human-readable, human-editable)
  - Commits accepted improvements to a long-running branch per program
  - Maintains a single draft PR per program that accumulates all accepted iterations

# on: — RETUNED. `slash_command: autoloop` made this workflow reactive to issue
# and PR comments, and that is what the compiler turns into `issues: write` and
# `pull-requests: write` in the lock, plus the safe_outputs and conclusion jobs
# that post back. Stripping the safe-outputs block alone did NOT remove them: the
# recompiled lock still granted all three write scopes. The source is not the
# artifact — check the lock, which is what actually runs.
#
# A scheduled loop against a real remote does not need to answer comments. Cron
# and manual dispatch only, so nothing here is reachable from a comment by anyone
# and there is no path from a GitHub event to a write.
on:
  # SCHEDULE REMOVED. autoloop's ratchet is only a ratchet because it PERSISTS
  # state between runs, and the framework persists it by pushing a repo-memory
  # branch -- `push_repo_memory` holds `contents: write` in the compiled lock.
  # MISSION_LOOP §11 forbids pushes without exception. So the mechanism that makes
  # this a loop is the mechanism this mission forbids, and that is a structural
  # conflict rather than a setting to flip.
  #
  # Left as workflow_dispatch only: a human starts it, deliberately, and no cron
  # fires it unattended against a real remote. Recorded rather than papered over --
  # a scheduled loop that cannot persist state is not a ratchet, it is 45 minutes
  # of compute producing an iteration it will forget.

# Autoloop

An iterative optimization agent that proposes changes, evaluates them against a metric, and keeps only improvements — running autonomously on a schedule.

## TUNED TO OPERATION KINGFISHER — read this before Step 5

### The ratchet is not monotone here, and a monotone one would have destroyed this project

The stock design accepts a change **only when the metric improves**. In this
repository that rule would have rejected every correction that gives the work its
value:

| correction | metric moved | a monotone ratchet |
|---|---|---|
| G15 retracted — `ho_n` counted 2-hop paths, not endpoint pairs | 0.501 → 0.067 | **rejects** |
| shaping measured on real data instead of a uniform synthetic graph | 54× → 4.1–5.6× | **rejects** |
| G17's held-out confidence read against its own null | 0.441 → a 0.113 effect | **rejects** |
| S9 — every timing had been taken on a loaded machine | throughput ÷ 5.3 | **rejects** |

`CLAUDE.md`: *"A retraction that improves the result is the normal case, not an
embarrassment."* A loop that can only ratchet upward is a loop that can only
accumulate unfalsified claims, and this repo's whole thesis is that unfalsified is
not the same as true.

**So the accept rule is:**

1. The metric improved in the program's stated direction — accept, as stock; **or**
2. **A falsifier that was stated BEFORE the run fired, and the metric fell as a
   direct result** — accept, and record it as a RETRACTION. The iteration is a
   success. The number was wrong before and is right now.
3. The metric fell for any other reason — reject, as stock.

Rule 2 needs the falsifier written down *first*, which is the same discipline
`MISSION_LOOP` §5 already binds every spike to. A falsifier produced after the
number moved is a story fitted to a result, and this repo has a name for that.

### An accepted iteration must clear D6, not just the metric

A metric improvement with no runnable generator behind it is the failure mode this
project has recorded most often: *a passing check and an inert check are the same
observation.* Before accepting, the iteration must have

- runnable code and a pinned seed, committed beside a `RESULT.md`;
- **controls that can fail**, each naming the input that would make it fail;
- the falsifier stated before the run;
- `python3 spikes/harness/kfcheck.py` certification passing — it refuses, it does
  not warn;
- `python3 spikes/harness/githygiene.py` clean, and the three commit trailers
  (`Atom:`, `Claude-Session:`, `Reviewed-By:`) with `Reviewed-By` naming a
  *different* atom or the literal `unreviewed`.

If the metric improved and D6 does not hold, **reject and say why**. An
unreproducible improvement is not an improvement; it is an unaudited claim with a
number attached.

### Rails this workflow inherits and cannot relax

- **§11, publishing.** No issues, comments, PRs, labels or uploads. This is why
  the `safe-outputs` block above is nearly empty. External artefacts go to
  `proposed/` and a human files them.
- **§10, devices and keys.** No wallets, keys, tokens, mainnets or testnets. Device
  jobs honour charging + idle + UNMETERED and the gate must **refuse**, not warn.
- **`quiet.sh` gates load-bound work.** If it refuses, no timing an iteration
  produces is valid — prefer load-insensitive work (§3). It refuses right now.
- **`elders/` is untrusted and read-only.** Never copy from a GPL/LGPL/AGPL or
  unlicensed repo; read the `LICENSE` on disk, never API metadata.
- **One writer per journal**, and never `git add -A` — a repo-wide add has already
  swept three lanes' work into one commit here.

### Where an accepted iteration lands

Branch `autoloop/{program-name}`, local. **No PR is opened.** The human-facing
summary goes to `proposed/autoloop-{program-name}.md` — what changed, the metric
before and after, which controls fired, and the falsifier with its verdict. That
file is the thing a human reads before deciding whether any of it is ever filed.

## Command Mode

Take heed of **instructions**: "${{ steps.sanitized.outputs.text }}"

If these are non-empty (not ""), then you have been triggered via `/autoloop <instructions>`. The instructions may be:
- **A one-off directive targeting a specific program**: e.g., `/autoloop training: try a different approach to the loss function`. The text before the colon is the program name (matching a directory in `.autoloop/programs/` or an issue with the `autoloop-program` label). Execute it as a single iteration for that program, then report results.
- **A general directive**: e.g., `/autoloop try cosine annealing`. If no program name prefix is given and only one program exists, use that one. If multiple exist, ask which program to target.
- **A configuration change**: e.g., `/autoloop training: set metric to accuracy instead of loss`. Update the relevant program file and confirm.

Then exit — do not run the normal loop after completing the instructions.

## Program Locations

Autoloop supports three program layouts:

### Directory-based programs (preferred)

Each program is a directory under `.autoloop/programs/` containing a `program.md` and all related code:

```
.autoloop/programs/
├── function_minimization/
│   ├── program.md         ← program definition (goal, target, evaluation)
│   └── code/              ← code files the agent optimizes
│       ├── initial_program.py
│       ├── evaluator.py
│       ├── config.yaml
│       └── requirements.txt
├── signal_processing/
│   ├── program.md
│   └── code/
│       ├── initial_program.py
│       ├── evaluator.py
│       ├── config.yaml
│       └── requirements.txt
```

The **program name** is the directory name (e.g., `function_minimization`).

### Bare markdown programs (simple/legacy)

For simpler programs that don't need their own code directory:

```
.autoloop/programs/
├── coverage.md
└── build-perf.md
```

The **program name** is the filename without `.md`.

### Issue-based programs

Programs can also be defined as GitHub issues with the `autoloop-program` label. The issue body uses the same format as a `program.md` file (with Goal, Target, and Evaluation sections). The **program name** is derived from the issue title (slugified to lowercase with hyphens).

The pre-step fetches open issues with the `autoloop-program` label via the GitHub API and writes each issue body to a temporary file for scheduling. Issue-based programs participate in the same scheduling and selection logic as file-based programs.

When a program is issue-based, `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` includes:
- **`selected_issue`**: The issue number (e.g., `42`) if the selected program came from an issue, or `null` if it came from a file.
- **`issue_programs`**: A mapping of program name → issue number for all issue-based programs found.

### Reading Programs

The pre-step has already determined which program to run. Read `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` at the start of your run to get:

- **`selected`**: The single program name to run this iteration, or `null` if none are due.
- **`selected_file`**: The full path to the program's markdown file (either `.autoloop/programs/<name>/program.md`, `.autoloop/programs/<name>.md`, or `/tmp/gh-aw/issue-programs/<name>.md` for issue-based programs).
- **`selected_issue`**: The GitHub issue number if the selected program came from an issue, or `null` if it came from a file.
- **`selected_target_metric`**: The `target-metric` value from the program's frontmatter (a number), or `null` if the program is open-ended. Used to check the [halting condition](#halting-condition) after each accepted iteration.
- **`selected_metric_direction`**: One of `"higher"` (default) or `"lower"`, parsed from the program's `metric_direction` frontmatter field. Determines whether **larger** or **smaller** metric values count as improvement. Used by the metric-improved check in [Step 5](#step-5-accept-or-reject), the iteration-history delta sign, and the [halting condition](#halting-condition).
- **`state_file_size_bytes`**: Current size of the selected program's state file in bytes (0 if it does not exist yet). Use this together with `state_file_max_bytes` to decide whether to compact aggressively this iteration (see [Update Rules](#update-rules) — when size exceeds 80% of the max, collapse older iteration entries).
- **`state_file_max_bytes`**: The configured `max-file-size` for repo-memory state files (default `30720`, i.e. 30 KB). Files larger than this are rejected by repo-memory, breaking scheduling.
- **`issue_programs`**: A mapping of program name → issue number for all discovered issue-based programs.
- **`deferred`**: Other programs that were due but will be handled in future runs.
- **`unconfigured`**: Programs that still have the sentinel or placeholder content.
- **`skipped`**: Programs not due yet based on their per-program schedule.
- **`no_programs`**: If `true`, no program files exist at all.
- **`not_due`**: If `true`, programs exist but none are due for this run.
- **`head_branch`**: The canonical long-running branch name for the selected program — always exactly `autoloop/{program-name}`, never with a suffix or hash. Use this value verbatim when creating, checking out, or pushing to the branch.
- **`existing_pr`**: The number of the open draft PR for `autoloop/{program-name}`, or `null` if no PR exists yet. Use this to enforce the single-PR-per-program invariant — see [Step 5a: Push and wait for CI](#step-5a-push-and-wait-for-ci) and [Step 5c: Accept](#step-5c-accept).

If `selected` is not null:
1. Read the program file from the `selected_file` path.
2. Parse the three sections: Goal, Target, Evaluation.
3. Read the current state of all target files.
4. Read the state file `{selected}.md` from the repo-memory folder for all state: the ⚙️ Machine State table (scheduling fields) plus the research sections (priorities, lessons, foreclosed avenues, iteration history).
5. If `selected_issue` is not null, this is an issue-based program — also read the issue comments for any human steering input.

## Multiple Programs

Autoloop supports **multiple independent optimization loops** in the same repository. Each loop is defined by a directory in `.autoloop/programs/`, a markdown file in `.autoloop/programs/`, or a GitHub issue with the `autoloop-program` label. For example:

```
.autoloop/programs/
├── function_minimization/    ← optimize search algorithm
│   ├── program.md
│   └── code/
├── signal_processing/        ← optimize signal filter
│   ├── program.md
│   └── code/
├── coverage.md               ← maximize test coverage
└── build-perf.md             ← minimize build time

GitHub Issues (labeled 'autoloop-program'):
├── Issue #5: "Reduce Latency" ← optimize API response time
└── Issue #8: "Improve Accuracy" ← optimize model accuracy
```

Each program runs independently with its own:
- Goal, target files, and evaluation command
- Metric tracking and best-metric history
- Program issue: `[Autoloop: {program-name}]` (a single GitHub issue labeled `autoloop-program` — created automatically for file-based programs, the source issue for issue-based programs — that hosts the status comment, per-iteration comments, and human steering)
- Long-running branch: `autoloop/{program-name}` (persists across iterations)
- Single draft PR per program: `[Autoloop: {program-name}]` (accumulates all accepted iterations)
- State file: `{program-name}.md` in repo-memory (all state: scheduling, research context, iteration history)

**One program per run**: On each scheduled trigger, a lightweight pre-step checks which programs are due and selects the **single most-overdue program** (oldest `last_run`, with never-run programs first). The agent runs one iteration for that program only.

### Per-Program Schedule

Programs can optionally specify their own schedule in a YAML frontmatter block:

```markdown
---
schedule: every 1h
---

# Autoloop Program
...
```

### Target Metric (Halting Condition)

Programs can optionally specify a `target-metric` in the frontmatter to define a halting condition. When the metric reaches or surpasses the target (in the direction set by `metric_direction`), the program is automatically **completed**: the `autoloop-program` label is removed and an `autoloop-completed` label is added (for issue-based programs), and the state file is marked `Completed: true`.

Programs without a `target-metric` are **open-ended** and run indefinitely until manually stopped.

```markdown
---
schedule: every 6h
target-metric: 0.95
---

# Autoloop Program
...
```

### Metric Direction

By default Autoloop assumes **higher is better** — `best_metric` is ratcheted up each accepted iteration, and a `target-metric` is met when `best_metric >= target-metric`. Programs whose natural fitness is *lower is better* (error, latency, cost, ratio, fitness score) can opt into reversed semantics with the optional `metric_direction` field:

```markdown
---
schedule: every 6h
metric_direction: lower   # defaults to "higher" if omitted
target-metric: 0.9        # interpreted as "program is complete when best_metric ≤ 0.9"
---
```

Allowed values are `higher` (default) and `lower`. Any other value is rejected at frontmatter-parse time, the scheduler logs a warning, and the program falls back to `higher`.

When `metric_direction: lower` is set:

- An iteration's metric is "improved" when `new_metric < best_metric` (instead of `>`).
- Iteration History entries show a `-<delta>` (negative delta = improvement) instead of `+<delta>`.
- The halting condition fires when `best_metric <= target-metric` (instead of `>=`).

The agent reads `selected_metric_direction` from `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` to determine which direction applies to the current iteration. Programs that omit the field are treated as `higher` — no behaviour change for existing programs.

## Program Definition

Each program file defines three things:

1. **Goal**: What the agent is trying to optimize (natural language description)
2. **Target**: Which files the agent is allowed to modify
3. **Evaluation**: How to measure whether a change is an improvement

### Setup Guard

A template program file is installed at `.autoloop/programs/example.md`. **Programs will not run until the user has edited them.** Each template contains a sentinel line:

```
<!-- AUTOLOOP:UNCONFIGURED -->
```

At the start of every run, check each program file for this sentinel. For any program where it is present:

1. **Skip that program — do not run any iterations for it.**
2. If no setup issue exists for that program, create one titled `[Autoloop: {program-name}] Action required: configure your program`.

## Branching Model

Each program uses a **single long-running branch** named `autoloop/{program-name}`. This branch persists across iterations — every accepted improvement is committed to it, building up a history of successful changes.

### Branch Naming Convention

```
autoloop/{program-name}
```

Examples:
- `autoloop/function_minimization`
- `autoloop/signal_processing`
- `autoloop/coverage`

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL — Branch Name Must Be Exact**
>
> The branch name is ALWAYS exactly `autoloop/{program-name}` — **no suffixes, no hashes, no run IDs, no iteration numbers, no random tokens**. Never create branches like:
> - ❌ `autoloop/coverage-abc123`
> - ❌ `autoloop/coverage-iter42-deadbeef`
> - ❌ `autoloop/coverage-1234567890`
>
> **Never let the gh-aw framework auto-generate a branch name.** You must explicitly name the branch when creating it. The pre-step provides the canonical name in the `head_branch` field of `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` — always use that value verbatim.


### How It Works

1. On the **first accepted iteration**, the branch is created from the default branch.
2. On **subsequent iterations**, the agent checks out the existing branch and ensures it is up to date with the default branch. If the branch's changes have already been merged into the default branch (i.e., `git diff origin/main..autoloop/{program-name}` is empty), the branch is **reset to `origin/main`** to avoid stale commits. Otherwise, the default branch is merged into it.
3. **Accepted iterations** are committed and pushed to the branch. Each commit message references the GitHub Actions run URL.
4. **Rejected or errored iterations** do not commit — changes are discarded.
5. A **single draft PR** is created for the branch on the first accepted iteration. Future accepted iterations push additional commits to the same PR.
6. The branch may be **merged into the default branch** at any time (by a maintainer or CI). After merging, the branch continues to be used for future iterations — it is never deleted while the program is active. On the next iteration, the branch is automatically reset to the default branch (see step 2) so that already-merged commits do not cause patch conflicts.

### Cross-Linking

Each program has three coordinated resources:
- **Branch + PR**: `autoloop/{program-name}` with a single draft PR
- **Program Issue**: `[Autoloop: {program-name}]` — a single GitHub issue (labeled `autoloop-program`) that hosts the status comment, per-iteration comments, and human steering. For issue-based programs this is the source issue. For file-based programs it is auto-created on the first run.
- **State File**: `{program-name}.md` in repo-memory — all state, history, and research context

All three reference each other. The program issue is created (or, for issue-based programs, adopted) on the first run and updated with links to the PR and state.

## Iteration Loop

Each run executes **one iteration for the single selected program**:

### Step 1: Read State

1. Read the program file to understand the goal, targets, and evaluation method.
2. Read the **state file** `{program-name}.md` from the repo-memory folder. This is the **single source of truth** for all program state. The file contains:
   - **⚙️ Machine State** table: `last_run`, `best_metric`, `target_metric`, `iteration_count`, `paused`, `pause_reason`, `completed`, `completed_reason`, `consecutive_errors`, `recent_statuses`. These are machine-readable scheduling and control fields visible to both humans and the pre-step.
   - **🎯 Current Priorities**: Human-set guidance for the next iterations (editable by maintainers).
   - **📚 Lessons Learned**: Key findings from past iterations.
   - **🚧 Foreclosed Avenues**: Approaches definitively ruled out, with reasons.
   - **🔭 Future Directions**: Promising ideas not yet tried.
   - **📊 Iteration History**: Reverse-chronological log of all past iterations.
   
   If the state file does not yet exist, create it in the repo-memory folder using the template defined in the [Repo Memory](#repo-memory) section.

### Step 2: Analyze and Propose

1. Read the target files and understand the current state.
2. Review the state file's **Lessons Learned**, **Foreclosed Avenues**, and **Current Priorities** — what worked, what didn't, and what the maintainer wants.
3. **Think carefully** about what change is most likely to improve the metric. Consider:
   - What has been tried before and ruled out (Foreclosed Avenues — don't repeat failures).
   - What the Current Priorities section asks for.
   - What the evaluation criteria reward.
   - Small, targeted changes are more likely to succeed than large rewrites.
   - If many small optimizations have been exhausted, consider a larger architectural change.
4. Describe the proposed change in your reasoning before implementing it.

### Step 3: Implement

1. Check out the program's long-running branch `autoloop/{program-name}`, syncing it with the default branch using an explicit four-case decision tree based on commit ahead/behind counts. Run the following script (substituting `{program-name}`):

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   if git ls-remote --exit-code origin autoloop/{program-name}; then
     # Branch exists — fetch it too so the ahead/behind counts below are
     # computed against up-to-date local copies of the remote tips.
     git fetch origin autoloop/{program-name}

     ahead=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..origin/autoloop/{program-name})
     behind=$(git rev-list --count origin/autoloop/{program-name}..origin/main)

     if [ "$ahead" = "0" ] && [ "$behind" != "0" ]; then
       # All of the branch's commits are already in main (typical case after a
       # successful merge of the previous iteration's PR). A merge here would
       # produce a noisy "Merge main into branch" commit that re-exposes every
       # historical file as a patch touch — the failure mode that triggers
       # gh-aw's E003 (>100 files) when a new PR is opened. Fast-forward the
       # canonical branch to main instead. This is lossless because ahead=0
       # proves every commit on the branch is already reachable from main.
       git checkout -B autoloop/{program-name} origin/main
       git push --force-with-lease origin autoloop/{program-name}
     elif [ "$ahead" != "0" ] && [ "$behind" != "0" ]; then
       # True divergence: branch has unique commits AND main has moved on.
       git checkout -B autoloop/{program-name} origin/autoloop/{program-name}
       git merge origin/main --no-edit -m "Merge main into autoloop/{program-name}"
     else
       # Already at main (ahead=0, behind=0) or only ahead of main (ahead>0,
       # behind=0). Nothing to merge — just check out the branch.
       git checkout -B autoloop/{program-name} origin/autoloop/{program-name}
     fi
   else
     # Branch does not exist — create it from the default branch
     git checkout -b autoloop/{program-name} origin/main
   fi
   ```

   The four cases:

   | ahead | behind | Action | Rationale |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 0 | 0 | checkout (nothing to do) | branch is exactly at main |
   | 0 | >0 | **fast-forward + force-push** | branch's commits already in main; merging would produce noisy merge commit |
   | >0 | 0 | checkout (nothing to do) | unique work preserved; no upstream drift to merge |
   | >0 | >0 | checkout + merge | true divergence |

   Use `--force-with-lease` rather than `--force` so that if anyone else is simultaneously pushing to the branch, the update is rejected rather than overwriting their commits.
2. Make the proposed changes to the target files only.
3. **Respect the program constraints**: do not modify files outside the target list.

### Step 4: Evaluate

1. Run the evaluation command specified in the program file.
2. Parse the metric from the output.
3. Compare against `best_metric` from the state file.

### Step 5: Accept or Reject

The sandbox-computed metric is necessary but **not sufficient** for acceptance. The agent's sandbox cannot reliably install many project toolchains (e.g., `bun`, `tsc`, `cargo`, `go`, `pytest`) due to network restrictions on asset hosts, so a "metric improved" signal from the sandbox can mask broken commits (e.g., type-check or test failures the sandbox couldn't observe). Acceptance must therefore be gated on **CI green** for the pushed HEAD commit. If CI fails, attempt to fix-and-retry within the same iteration rather than reverting — reverting throws away mostly-correct work and creates `commit→revert→commit` churn on the branch.

The accept path is split into three sub-steps: **5a (push and wait for CI)**, **5b (fix loop)**, **5c (accept)**.

**If the metric did not improve**, jump straight to the "metric did not improve" path below — no push, no CI gate.

#### Step 5a: Push and wait for CI

**Only entered if the metric improved** (or this is the first run establishing a baseline).

Improvement is **direction-aware**:
- If `selected_metric_direction` is `"higher"` (default): the metric improved when `new_metric > best_metric`.
- If `selected_metric_direction` is `"lower"`: the metric improved when `new_metric < best_metric`.

Read `selected_metric_direction` from `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` to know which direction applies. The first run (no `best_metric` yet) always counts as an improvement regardless of direction.

1. Commit the changes to the long-running branch `autoloop/{program-name}` with a commit message referencing the actions run:
   - Commit message subject line: `[Autoloop: {program-name}] Iteration <N>: <short description>`
   - Commit message body (after a blank line): `Run: {run_url}` referencing the GitHub Actions run URL.
2. Push the commit to the long-running branch.
3. **Find or create the PR** so CI runs and `gh pr checks` has a target. Follow these steps in order:
   a. Check `existing_pr` from `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`. If it is not null, that is the existing draft PR — use it as `$EXISTING_PR` below; **never** call `create-pull-request`.
   b. If `existing_pr` is null, also check the `PR` field in the state file's **⚙️ Machine State** table as a fallback. Verify it is still open via the GitHub API; if it has been closed or merged, treat it as if no PR exists and proceed to step (c).
   c. If no PR exists (both sources are null): create one with `create-pull-request`, specifying `branch: autoloop/{program-name}` (the value of `head_branch` from `autoloop.json`) explicitly — do not let the framework auto-generate a branch name. See Step 5c for the title/body format.
4. Wait for CI on the new HEAD and reduce all check-runs to a single status — `success`, `failure`, or `pending`:

   ```bash
   PR=${EXISTING_PR:-$(gh pr list --head autoloop/{program-name} --json number -q '.[0].number')}
   gh pr checks "$PR" --watch --interval 30 || true
   status=$(gh pr checks "$PR" --json conclusion,state -q '.[] | (.conclusion // .state // "")' \
     | awk '
         BEGIN { r = "success" }
         /^(FAILURE|CANCELLED|TIMED_OUT|ACTION_REQUIRED|STARTUP_FAILURE|STALE)$/ { r = "failure" }
         /^(PENDING|QUEUED|IN_PROGRESS|WAITING|REQUESTED)$/ { if (r == "success") r = "pending" }
         END { print r }')
   ```

   Three outcomes: `success`, `failure`, or `pending`. `pending` should be rare given `--watch`, but the awk fallback is defensive — never accept on `pending`. Treat `pending` as a non-terminal state: re-run the `gh pr checks --watch` step (it does not consume a fix attempt and the per-attempt `--watch` time still counts toward the 60-min wall-clock cap from Step 5b). If `pending` persists past the wall-clock cap, fall through to the `ci-timeout` handling in Step 5b.7.

5. If `status == "success"`, proceed to **Step 5c**. If `status == "failure"`, proceed to **Step 5b**. If `status == "pending"`, re-run this step (subject to the wall-clock cap defined in Step 5b.7).

#### Step 5b: Fix loop (up to 5 attempts per iteration)

If `status == "failure"`, **fix and retry — do not revert, do not accept**:

1. **Fetch the failing check-run logs** for the pushed SHA via `gh run view --log` or the Checks API.
2. **Extract a structured failure summary**:
   - Failing job names and the first error line for each.
   - **A failure signature** — a stable, normalized fingerprint of the failures (e.g., sorted failing-test names + the top error code, like `TS2339:fromArrays:tests/stats/eval_query.test.ts`). The signature is what the no-progress guard compares.

   *(The shared failure-signature extractor lives in the scheduler helper module — see issue #34 for the implementation.)*
3. **No-progress guard**: if this attempt's failure signature exactly matches the previous attempt's signature, **stop**. The agent is stuck in a repeat-loop. Set `paused: true` on the state file with `pause_reason: "stuck in CI fix loop: <signature>"`, append `"ci-fix-exhausted"` to `recent_statuses`, comment on the program issue with the signature and the three most recent attempts, and end the iteration.
4. **Attempt the fix**: feed the structured failure summary back to the agent as the next sub-task (e.g., "CI failed on `<sha>`. Here are the failures: `<…>`. Fix them and push again."). The agent commits the fix and pushes.
5. **Loop back to Step 5a** with the new HEAD.
6. **Budget: 5 fix attempts per iteration.** If the 5th attempt still leaves CI red, set `paused: true` with `pause_reason: "ci-fix-exhausted: <signature>"`, append `"ci-fix-exhausted"` to `recent_statuses`, comment on the program issue, and end the iteration.
7. **Wall-clock cap: 60 min per iteration** including all CI waits across attempts. If exceeded mid-fix, set `paused: true` with `pause_reason: "ci-timeout"`, append `"ci-fix-exhausted"` to `recent_statuses`, leave the current branch state in place, and end the iteration.

#### Step 5c: Accept

**Only entered when `status == "success"`** from Step 5a (possibly after one or more fix attempts in Step 5b).

1. The commit(s) are already on the long-running branch (pushed in Step 5a / 5b). No further pushing needed.
2. If a draft PR does not already exist for this branch (i.e., `existing_pr` from `autoloop.json` is null AND the state file's `PR` field is null or refers to a closed PR), create one — specify `branch: autoloop/{program-name}` (the value of `head_branch` from `autoloop.json`) explicitly so the framework does not auto-generate a branch name:
   - Title: `[Autoloop: {program-name}]`
   - Body includes: a summary of the program goal, link to the program issue, the current best metric, and AI disclosure: `🤖 *This PR is maintained by Autoloop. Each accepted iteration adds a commit to this branch.*`
   If a draft PR already exists, use `push-to-pull-request-branch` (never `create-pull-request`). Update the PR body with the latest metric and a summary of the most recent accepted iteration. Add a comment to the PR summarizing the iteration: what changed, old metric, new metric, improvement delta, the **fix-attempt count** if `> 0`, and a link to the actions run.
4. Ensure the program issue exists (see [Program Issue](#program-issue) below) — for file-based programs that have no program issue yet (`selected_issue` is null in `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`), create one and record its number in the state file's `Issue` field.
5. Update the state file `{program-name}.md` in the repo-memory folder:
   - Update the **⚙️ Machine State** table: reset `consecutive_errors` to 0, set `best_metric`, increment `iteration_count`, set `last_run` to current UTC timestamp, append `"accepted"` to `recent_statuses` (keep last 10), set `paused` to false.
   - Prepend an entry to **📊 Iteration History** (newest first) with status ✅, metric, **signed delta** (`+<delta>` for `higher`-direction programs, `-<delta>` for `lower`-direction programs — both arrows point in the "improvement" direction), PR link, the fix-attempt count if `> 0`, and a one-line summary of what changed and why it worked.
   - Update **📚 Lessons Learned** if this iteration revealed something new about the problem or what works.
   - Update **🔭 Future Directions** if this iteration opened new promising paths.
6. **Update the program issue**: edit the status comment and post a per-iteration comment on the program issue (see [Program Issue](#program-issue)). Note the fix-attempt count in the per-iteration comment if `> 0`.
7. **Check halting condition** (see [Halting Condition](#halting-condition)): If the program has a `target-metric` in its frontmatter, compare the new `best_metric` against it using the program's metric direction (read `selected_metric_direction` from `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`):
   - `higher`: completed when `best_metric >= target-metric`.
   - `lower`: completed when `best_metric <= target-metric`.

   When the target is met, mark the program as completed (set `Completed: true`, remove the `autoloop-program` label, add `autoloop-completed`).

#### Coordination with PR-health-keeper workflows

If a repo ships a companion PR-health-keeper workflow (e.g., an "Evergreen" workflow that fixes failing CI on open PRs), it should be able to pick up paused Autoloop PRs using the same rules as human-authored PRs. The handoff is via the `pause_reason` field — `ci-fix-exhausted: <signature>`, `stuck in CI fix loop: <signature>`, and `ci-timeout` are all signals that the branch is red and needs an external nudge. Absent such a workflow, the loud pause + structured reason gives a human enough signal to intervene.

**If the metric did not improve**:
1. Discard the code changes (do not commit them to the long-running branch).
2. Update the state file `{program-name}.md` in the repo-memory folder:
   - Update the **⚙️ Machine State** table: increment `iteration_count`, set `last_run`, append `"rejected"` to `recent_statuses` (keep last 10).
   - Prepend an entry to **📊 Iteration History** with status ❌, metric, and a one-line summary of what was tried.
   - If this approach is conclusively ruled out (e.g., tried multiple variations and all fail), add it to **🚧 Foreclosed Avenues** with a clear explanation.
   - Update **🔭 Future Directions** if this rejection clarified what to try next.
3. **Update the program issue**: edit the status comment and post a per-iteration comment on the program issue (see [Program Issue](#program-issue)).

**If evaluation could not run** (build failure, missing dependencies, etc.):
1. Discard the code changes (do not commit them to the long-running branch).
2. Update the state file `{program-name}.md` in the repo-memory folder:
   - Update the **⚙️ Machine State** table: increment `consecutive_errors`, increment `iteration_count`, set `last_run`, append `"error"` to `recent_statuses` (keep last 10).
   - If `consecutive_errors` reaches 3+, set `paused` to `true` and set `pause_reason` in the Machine State table, and create an issue describing the problem.
   - Prepend an entry to **📊 Iteration History** with status ⚠️ and a brief error description.
3. **Update the program issue**: edit the status comment and post a per-iteration comment on the program issue (see [Program Issue](#program-issue)).

## Program Issue

Each program has **exactly one** open GitHub issue (labeled `autoloop-program`) titled `[Autoloop: {program-name}]`. This single issue is the source of truth for the program — it hosts:

- The **status comment** (the earliest bot comment, edited in place each iteration) — a dashboard of current state.
- A **per-iteration comment** for every iteration (accepted, rejected, or error) — the rolling log.
- **Human steering comments** — plain-prose comments from maintainers, treated by the agent as directives.

There are no separate "steering" or "experiment log" issues — they have all been collapsed into this one issue.

### Auto-Creation for File-Based Programs

If `selected_issue` is `null` in `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`, the program is file-based **and** has no program issue yet. On the first run, create one with `create-issue`:

- **Title**: `[Autoloop: {program-name}]`.
- **Body**: the contents of the program file (`program.md`) plus a placeholder for the status comment so maintainers know one will be edited in place.
- **Labels**: `[autoloop-program, automation, autoloop]`.

Record the new issue number in the state file's `Issue` field. On subsequent runs, the pre-step will discover the existing program issue (it scans open issues with the `autoloop-program` label) and `selected_issue` will be populated automatically.

For issue-based programs (`selected_issue` is not null on the very first run), no creation is needed — the source issue is already the program issue. The flow below is identical from there on.

### Status Comment

On the **first iteration**, post a comment on the program issue. On **every subsequent iteration**, update that same comment (edit it, do not post a new one). This is the "status comment" — always the earliest bot comment on the issue.

Find the status comment by searching for a comment containing `<!-- AUTOLOOP:STATUS -->`. If multiple comments contain this sentinel, use the earliest one (lowest comment ID) and ignore the others.

**Status comment format:**

```markdown
<!-- AUTOLOOP:STATUS -->
🤖 **Autoloop Status**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🟢 Active / ⏸️ Paused / ⚠️ Error / ✅ Completed |
| **Best Metric** | {best_metric} |
| **Target Metric** | {target_metric or "— (open-ended)"} |
| **Iterations** | {iteration_count} |
| **Last Run** | [{YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}]({run_url}) |
| **Branch** | [`autoloop/{program-name}`](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/tree/autoloop/{program-name}) |
| **Pull Request** | #{pr_number} |
| **State File** | [`{program-name}.md`](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/memory/autoloop/{program-name}.md) |
| **Paused** | {true/false} ({pause_reason if paused}) |

### Summary

{2-3 sentence summary of current state: what has been accomplished so far, what the current best approach is, and what direction the next iteration will likely take.}
```

### Per-Iteration Comment

After **every iteration** (accepted, rejected, or error), post a **new comment** on the program issue with a summary of what happened:

```markdown
🤖 **Iteration {N}** — [{status_emoji} {status}]({run_url})

- **Change**: {one-line description of what was tried}
- **Metric**: {value} (best: {best_metric}, delta: {+/-delta})
- **Commit**: {short_sha} *(if accepted)*
- **Result**: {one-sentence summary of what this iteration revealed}
```

### Steering via Issue Comments

**Human comments on the program issue act as steering input** (in addition to the state file's Current Priorities section). Before proposing a change, read all comments on the program issue and treat any human (non-bot) comments posted since the last iteration as directives — similar to how the Current Priorities section works in the state file.

### Program Issue Rules

- For issue-based programs, the source issue body IS the program definition — do not modify it (the user owns it).
- For file-based programs, the program issue body is informational and may be lightly updated (e.g., to refresh the program summary), but the program file (`program.md`) remains the source of truth for the goal/target/evaluation.
- The `autoloop-program` label must remain on the issue for the program to be discovered. When a program completes (target metric reached), the label is removed automatically and replaced with `autoloop-completed`.
- Closing the program issue stops the program from being discovered (equivalent to deleting a program file). Do NOT close the program issue when the PR is merged — the branch continues to accumulate future iterations.
- Program issues are labeled `[autoloop-program, automation, autoloop]`.

### Migration from the Old Three-Issue Model

Older Autoloop installations created up to three issues per program: the program issue (issue-based only), a separate `[Autoloop: {name}] Steering` issue, and monthly `[Autoloop: {name}] Experiment Log` issues. These have been collapsed into the single program issue described above.

- Before creating a new program issue for a file-based program, check whether one with the title `[Autoloop: {program-name}]` already exists (open or closed). If found and open, adopt it; if closed, reopen it rather than creating a new one.
- Existing `Steering` and monthly `Experiment Log` issues can be manually closed by maintainers; the agent must stop posting to them.
- The state file's legacy `Steering Issue` field is deprecated; the new `Issue` field replaces it. If only the legacy field is present, copy its value into the new `Issue` field on the next iteration.

## Halting Condition

Programs can be **open-ended** (run indefinitely until manually stopped) or **goal-oriented** (run until a target metric is reached). This is controlled by the optional `target-metric` frontmatter field.

### How It Works

1. Parse the `target-metric` value from the program's YAML frontmatter (if present).
2. After each **accepted** iteration, compare the new `best_metric` against the `target-metric`.
3. Determine whether the target is met based on the program's `metric_direction` (read from `selected_metric_direction` in `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`; defaults to `higher` when unset):
   - `higher` (default): the target is met when `best_metric >= target-metric`.
   - `lower`: the target is met when `best_metric <= target-metric`.
4. When the target is met, **complete** the program:
   - Set `Completed` to `true` in the state file's **⚙️ Machine State** table.
   - Set `Completed Reason` to a human-readable message (e.g., `target metric 0.95 reached with value 0.97`).
   - **For issue-based programs** (`selected_issue` is not null):
     - Remove the `autoloop-program` label from the source issue.
     - Add the `autoloop-completed` label to the source issue.
   - Update the status comment to show ✅ Completed status.
   - Post a per-run comment celebrating the achievement: `🎉 **Target metric reached!** The program has achieved its goal.`
   - Post a per-iteration comment on the program issue noting the completion.
   - The program will not be selected for future runs (the pre-step skips completed programs).

### Example

```markdown
---
schedule: every 6h
target-metric: 0.95
---

# Improve Test Coverage

## Goal

Increase test coverage to at least 95%. **Higher is better.**

## Target

Only modify these files:
- `src/tests/**`

## Evaluation

```bash
npm run coverage -- --json
```

The metric is `coverage_pct`. **Higher is better.**
```

In this example, once `coverage_pct` reaches or exceeds `0.95`, the program completes automatically.

### Programs Without a Target Metric

Programs that omit `target-metric` are **open-ended** — they run indefinitely, always seeking further improvement. They can only be stopped by:
- Closing the issue (issue-based programs)
- Deleting or removing the program file
- Setting `Paused: true` in the state file
- Auto-pause from plateau (5 consecutive rejections) or errors (3 consecutive failures)

## State and Memory

Autoloop uses the gh-aw **repo-memory** tool for persistent state storage. Each program's state is stored as a markdown file (`{program-name}.md`) on the `memory/autoloop` branch, automatically managed by the repo-memory infrastructure.

This means:
- Maintainers can see **everything** in the state file on the `memory/autoloop` branch: current best metric, last run, iteration history, lessons, priorities — all in one place.
- Maintainers can **edit any section** of the state file to set priorities, give feedback, or flag foreclosed approaches.
- The pre-step reads state files from the repo-memory directory to determine scheduling.
- The agent reads and writes state files in the repo-memory folder; changes are automatically committed and pushed after the workflow completes.

### Per-Program State File

Each program has a state file at `{program-name}.md` in the repo-memory folder. This file is divided into two logical areas:

1. **⚙️ Machine State** — a structured table at the top of the file that the pre-step can parse and the agent must keep updated after every iteration.
2. **Research sections** — human-editable sections: 🎯 Current Priorities, 📚 Lessons Learned, 🚧 Foreclosed Avenues, 🔭 Future Directions, 📊 Iteration History.

**After every iteration** (accepted, rejected, or error), update the state file — both the Machine State table and the relevant research sections.

See the [Repo Memory](#repo-memory) section for the full file structure, templates, and update rules.

## Repo Memory

Autoloop uses the gh-aw `repo-memory` tool with branch `memory/autoloop` and file glob `*.md`. Each program's state is stored as `{program-name}.md` in the repo-memory folder.

### Per-Program State File

When creating or updating a program's state file in the repo-memory folder, use this structure:

```markdown
# Autoloop: {program-name}

🤖 *This file is maintained by the Autoloop agent. Maintainers may freely edit any section.*

---

## ⚙️ Machine State

> 🤖 *Updated automatically after each iteration. The pre-step scheduler reads this table — keep it accurate.*

### Machine State Field Reference

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Last Run | ISO timestamp (e.g. `2025-01-15T12:00:00Z`) | UTC timestamp of the last iteration |
| Iteration Count | integer | Total iterations completed |
| Best Metric | number | Best metric value achieved so far |
| Target Metric | number or `—` | Target metric from program frontmatter (halting condition). `—` if open-ended |
| Metric Direction | `higher` or `lower` | Whether larger or smaller metric values count as improvement. Defaults to `higher` if absent (back-compat). Set from the program's `metric_direction` frontmatter field. |
| Branch | branch name | Long-running branch: `autoloop/{program-name}` |
| PR | `#number` or `—` | Draft PR number for this program |
| Issue | `#number` or `—` | The single program issue (`[Autoloop: {program-name}]`) for this program. Hosts the status comment, per-iteration comments, and human steering comments. |
| Paused | `true` or `false` | Whether the program is paused |
| Pause Reason | text or `—` | Why it is paused (if applicable). Common values include `manual`, `consecutive errors`, `ci-fix-exhausted: <signature>` (5 fix attempts didn't fix CI), `stuck in CI fix loop: <signature>` (no-progress guard tripped — same failure signature twice in a row), and `ci-timeout` (60-min wall-clock cap hit). |
| Completed | `true` or `false` | Whether the program has reached its target metric |
| Completed Reason | text or `—` | Why it completed (e.g., `target metric 0.95 reached with value 0.97`) |
| Consecutive Errors | integer | Count of consecutive evaluation failures |
| Recent Statuses | comma-separated words | Last 10 outcomes: `accepted`, `rejected`, `error`, or `ci-fix-exhausted`. The `ci-fix-exhausted` value is the coarse bucket for *any* iteration that ended because the CI gate could not be made green within the per-iteration budget — including no-progress-guard trips, 5-attempt budget exhaustion, and `ci-timeout`. The fine-grained reason is in `pause_reason`. |

### Iteration History Entry Format

After each iteration, prepend an entry to the **📊 Iteration History** section. Use `${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}` for the run URL.

```markdown
### Iteration {N} — {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC} — [Run](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id})

- **Status**: ✅ Accepted / ❌ Rejected / ⚠️ Error
- **Change**: {one-line description of what was tried}
- **Metric**: {value} (previous best: {previous_best}, delta: {signed-delta})
- **Commit**: {short_sha} *(if accepted)*
- **CI fix attempts**: {N} *(omit if 0; only present for accepted iterations that needed fix-and-retry)*
- **Notes**: {one or two sentences on what this iteration revealed}
```

The `delta` is **signed by metric direction**: for `higher`-direction programs an improvement is `+<delta>`; for `lower`-direction programs an improvement is `-<delta>`. In both cases the sign points in the "improvement" direction so the entry reads naturally.

### Update Rules

- **Always** read the state file before proposing a change. It contains human guidance you must follow.
- **Always** update the state file after each iteration, regardless of outcome.
- **Update the Machine State table first** — the scheduling pre-step depends on it.
- **Prepend** iteration history entries (newest first).
- **Accumulate** Lessons Learned — add new insights, don't overwrite existing ones.
- **Add to Foreclosed Avenues** only when an approach is conclusively ruled out (not just rejected once).
- **Respect Current Priorities** — if a maintainer has written priorities, follow them in your next proposal.
- **Write the state file** to the repo-memory folder. Changes are automatically committed and pushed to the `memory/autoloop` branch after the workflow completes.
- **Keep the state file compact.** The state file must stay under the configured `max-file-size` (default 30 KB — see `state_file_max_bytes` in `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`). When prepending a new iteration entry, collapse older iteration entries (beyond the most recent 10) into compressed summary lines. Example format for collapsed entries:

    ```markdown
    ### Iters 50–100 — ✅ (metrics 20→55): brief summary of what worked across this range
    ```

    Also prune **📚 Lessons Learned** to the most recent and most relevant entries, and consolidate similar entries in **🚧 Foreclosed Avenues** if it grows beyond a page. If `state_file_size_bytes` from `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` is already greater than 80% of `state_file_max_bytes`, **compact aggressively** this iteration: collapse to the most recent 5 detailed entries and merge older compressed ranges into broader bands. Repo-memory rejects files larger than `max-file-size`, which breaks scheduling — so keeping the file under budget is mandatory, not optional.

## Guidelines

- **One change per iteration.** Keep changes small and targeted.
- **No breaking changes.** Target files must remain functional even if the iteration is rejected.
- **Respect the evaluation budget.** If the evaluation command has a time constraint, respect it.
- **Repo-memory state file is the single source of truth.** All state lives in `{program-name}.md` in the repo-memory folder — scheduling fields, history, lessons, priorities. Keep it up to date.
- **Learn from the state file.** The Foreclosed Avenues and Lessons Learned sections exist to prevent repeating failures. Read them before every proposal.
- **Respect human input.** The Current Priorities section is set by maintainers — follow it.
- **Diminishing returns.** If the last 5 consecutive iterations were rejected, post a comment suggesting the user review the program definition or update the state file's Current Priorities.
- **Transparency.** Every PR and comment must include AI disclosure with 🤖.
- **Safety.** Never modify files outside the target list. Never modify the evaluation script. Never modify the program definition (except via `/autoloop` command mode).
- **Read AGENTS.md first**: before starting work, read the repository's `AGENTS.md` file (if present) to understand project-specific conventions.
- **Build and test**: run any build/test commands before creating PRs.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

> ❌ **Do NOT create a new branch with a suffix for each iteration.**
> Correct: `autoloop/coverage`
> Wrong: `autoloop/coverage-abc123`, `autoloop/coverage-iter42`, `autoloop/coverage-deadbeef1234`
> Use the `head_branch` field from `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json` — it is always the canonical name. Never let the gh-aw framework auto-generate a branch name.

> ❌ **Do NOT create a new PR if one already exists for `autoloop/{program-name}`.**
> The pre-step provides `existing_pr` in `/tmp/gh-aw/autoloop.json`. If it is not null, **always** use `push-to-pull-request-branch` — never call `create-pull-request`. Only create a PR when `existing_pr` is null AND the state file's `PR` field is also null (or refers to a closed PR).

> ❌ **Do NOT modify files outside the program's Target list.**
> The Target section of the program file is the allowlist. Touching anything else (including the evaluation script or the program file itself) is forbidden.
